Chapter 2
===

_I just logged in and died?_  

Sam was utterly bewildered. The start of the game was supposed to be dead simple, targeted at non-gamers. You had to be either really clueless or inept to die before the first checkpoint.  

_WTF is going on? It's as if I had some sort of degen as soon I as I moved._  
  
Sam took a peek at Chris's screen where everything seemed to be normal.  
Thinking that it must have been some sort of fluke, Sam deleted his character and remade a new one, ready to start for real.  
  
[Logging in...]

This time, Sam carefully watched his character HP, and started moving. Sure enough, his HP slid down right away.  
  
[You have died.]

_I don't see any bleed status, so how can this be happening?_  
Feeling embarrassed, Sam quickly deleted and remade the character once more, hoping Chris didn't notice anything.  

[Logging in...]

This time, in order to survive, Sam used all of his starting potions just to reach the town checkpoint safely.  
  
_I'll need some regen equipment & skills in order to progress at all._  
  
Despite this setback, Sam was still in a good mood - challenges were nothing but motivation. He quickly bought potions with his starting gold and found a high monster density spot not too far from town. By not moving from the spot, his HP would not degen and he could lower his potion use.  
  
After a few minutes of farming, Sam acquired a full set of equipments with regen mods. 

_These equips are all trash quality, but I guess I don't have a choice with this permanent degen._  
  
The farming also netted Sam a fair amount of exp and levels. Originally, Sam had intended to spend all his early skill points into damage, but the situation had changed. He upgraded the passive regen and max HP pool attributes.  
  
_I should have enough regen to progress as originally planned now. I even have extra town portal scrolls as a backup plan._
  
Moving onto the next zone, Sam concentrated on speed and efficiency, skipping all but the high density monster clusters. He glanced over at Chris, who seemed to be doing quite well and already far ahead of Sam. Determined to catch up, Sam resumed playing once more.  
  
Both Sam and Chris were so focused on the new expansion that they only just noticed the deafening silence in the classroom.  
  
The intercom announcements had stopped.  
The chatter amongst classmates had stopped.  
The police sirens outside had stopped.  
  
Sam slowly cranked his head up, fearing he had been caught by the teacher.  
Before he could see anything, the classroom window shattered, piercing the silence and causing both Sam and Chris to flinch sharply. A loud crash followed as the metallic blinds collided into the floor.  
  
Sam's body was frozen with fear but his heart and mind were pounding. Chris was in a similar state of shock, but his eyes weren't even looking at the window. Instead, he was staring dead straight at the teacher. As Sam shifted his gaze to the center of the classroom where the teacher stood, a flood of emotions and thoughts raced through Sam's mind.

_Did we get caught? What should my excuse be? Why is the whole class looking at us? I didn't break the window._  
  
Then, Sam realized what was horribly wrong. The teacher's face had no eyes, but instead, endless black pits. The mouth was wrong too - it was somehow upside down and slightly inverted. That smile was actually a nasty frown and sent shivers down Sam's spine. Every classmate except for Chris had the same horrifically disfigured face, staring straight at Sam & Chris.  
  
_What the fuck? WHAT THE FUCK? That's not human._  
  
Instinct kicking in, Sam jumped over his desk, leaped out of the broken window, and ran for his life.  

[You have died.]
